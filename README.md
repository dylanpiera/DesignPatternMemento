## Info
This is a example of a Memento Design Pattern implementation. 

## How to Run
To setup Try .NET all you need to do is install the dotnet SDK & the dotnet try tool. [See Setup in the Try .NET repo](https://github.com/dotnet/try/blob/master/README.md#setup)

After you have dotnet try installed (you can double check this by typing `dotnet try -h`, it should show two commands `demo` and `verify`)

Clone this repo to your local and inside of the root of this repo open a command line and run `dotnet try`.
